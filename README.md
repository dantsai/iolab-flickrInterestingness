<h1>Flickr Interestingness Explorer</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Flickr has a secret "interestingness" algorithm that picks 500 photos a day that it determines as the most "interesting". This visualization allows you to explore the tags associated with these interesting photos, as well as the cameras they were taken by. You can select a month's worth of photos -- we grab over a thousand photos for the selected month (exact amount varies, as returned by the Flickr API), and display the top 15 tags, or top 12 cameras.</p>

<p>It is quite interesting (pun intended..) to see how popular tags change over the course of year, and to see how the tags/cameras used change over the years.</p>
